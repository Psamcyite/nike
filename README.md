# Windows 10 Clone

This project is a React-based implementation of a Windows 10 clone, aiming to replicate the look and feel of the popular operating system. It provides a graphical user interface similar to Windows 10, complete with a desktop, start menu, taskbar, and various application windows.

## Features

1. **Desktop Interface:** The application features a desktop environment with icons representing various applications and shortcuts. Users can interact with the desktop, move icons, and customize their arrangement.

2. **Start Menu:** A fully functional Start menu provides access to a list of applications. The menu is designed to closely resemble the Windows 10 Start menu, offering a seamless and familiar user experience.

3. **Taskbar:** The bottom of the screen hosts a taskbar that includes the date, time, and system tray. Running applications are displayed on the taskbar, allowing users to easily switch between open windows.

4. **Application Windows:** Users can launch applications from the desktop or Start menu, and each application opens in its own window. These windows can be moved, resized, and closed, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
